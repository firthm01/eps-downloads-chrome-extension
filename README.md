# eps-downloads-chrome-extension
An Extension for Chrome-based browsers to track downloads of the EAR Production Suite releases
Thrown together in a couple of hours and my first attempt at a Chrome extension :)
It's not pretty, but it does the job and also serves as a nice, simple example for anyone else wanting to start with Chrome extensions.

## To Install:
- Dump this repo in to a folder
- Open Chrome-based browser and go to chrome://extensions/ (or equivalent, or go to "Manage Extension" or similar via the menu)
- Flick the toggle to enable "Developer mode"
- Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the `extension` subdir of this repo (i.e, point it to where `manifest.json` is)
Optional - making it easily accessible:
- From the Extensions window, click the "Details" button on the "EPS Download Stats" extension.
- Flick the toggle to enable "Pin to toolbar"
